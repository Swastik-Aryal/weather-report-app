This is pretty basic weather report app that provides you the TEMPERATURE and WEATHER CONDITIONS of a place.

I built this project basically to understand how APIs work in python.

Before using make sure to have Tkinter installed on your PC.

For this, use the command line

" pip install Tk"

in your terminal.
